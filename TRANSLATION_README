If you want to translate OpenStreetBrowser to another language, please
note the following points:

1. All language strings are defined in the following files, where XX is
  the abbreviation of the language (e.g. "en" for English, "en-gb" for
  British English):
  - www/lang/XX.php
  - www/lang/tags_XX.php
  - www/plugins/*/lang_XX.php

  There are still files www/lang/XX.js, but these should be removed soon
  and replaced by entries in the XX.php, as all strings will be exported
  to the JavaScript code.

  Before reading the localized language file the English file will be
  read, therefore if a string is not defined in your language its
  English original will be used.

  The representative list of translation strings is the English list.
  Strings defined in other languages and not in English should be
  deprecated. The are many strings in the English version which are
  depreacted but still being used. Those might be removed anytime soon.

2. Every language string looks like this:
  $lang_str["restaurant"]=array("Restaurant", "Restaurants");
  the first entry is the translation of the language string in Singular,
  the second the Plural form.

  Optionally you can define the Gender (F, M, N) of this word, e.g. the
  German translation for office:
  $lang_str["office"]=array(N, "Büro", "Büros");

  If a Singular/Plural form is not
  suitable/necessary you can ignore the array, e.g.
  $lang_str["help"]="Help";

3. All tags should have translations in www/lang/tags_XX.php, with
  language strings like "tag:key" for the translation of the key and
  "tag:key=value" for the translation of the value. E.g.
  $lang_str["tag:amenity"]=array("Amenity", "Amenities");
  $lang_str["tag:amenity=bar"]=array("Bar", "Bars");

  Furthermore you can describe the tags with the array $tag_type. Every
  entry is an array again to further specify its type, e.g.:
  $tag_type["width"]=array("number", "m", "in");
                ^             ^       ^    ^
                |             |       |    \-- the preferred unit in this locale
                |             |       \------- the default unit for this tag
                |             \--------------- the type of the value
                \----------------------------- tag

  This defines, that the default value for the tag width is a number, with
  its default unit m (for meter) and the preferred unit for this locale is
  in (for inch).

  The following types are valid:
  * text          default (e.g. religion, name)
  * number        a value, with default unit and preferred unit as defined
                  by the second and third entry in this array (e.g. width,
                  voltage)
  * count         an integer value (e.g. population)
  * date          a date
  * link          an Internet URL

  NOTE: the $tag_type can already be defined, but it's not used yet.
  There might also be more tag types soon and a way to format the output
  (e.g. "100.000 m" or "2010-12-24").

4. Add your language to www/lang/list.php

5. You can check the state of the translation using the page
  http://ROOT_PATH/scripts/check_lang.php (e.g.
  http://www.openstreetbrowser.org/scripts/check_lang.php).
